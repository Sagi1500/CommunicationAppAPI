## Services
We created services for User, contact, message, and AppHub services. Each of them has an ApplicationContext file that provides the opportunity to read and write to the database. In addition, AppHub has a dictionary that connects between 2 strings. The key is the connection Id filed and the value is the UserId (username).

## Hubs
We created AppHub and its service in order to provide SignalR communication between the client and the server.
